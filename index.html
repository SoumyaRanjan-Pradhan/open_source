    <h1>Open Source</h1>
    <p>Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers
        can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application</p>

    <p>An open-source repository on GitHub is a publicly accessible project where developers can collaborate,
        contribute, and share code. It promotes transparency, allowing anyone to review, modify, and enhance the
        software. This fosters innovation, learning, and community-driven development, making it a powerful tool for
        advancing technology and solving real-world problems.</p>

    <h1>Benefits of Open-Source Repositories</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Collaboration: Open-source repositories enable developers from around the world to work together on the same
            project. This collaboration can lead to more robust and innovative software.</li>
        <li>Transparency: Open-source projects are transparent, allowing anyone to inspect the code for security
            vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, or bugs. This openness leads to higher quality software.</li>
        <li>Community Building: Open-source projects often have strong communities that provide support, share
            knowledge, and drive the project forward.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Key Features for Open Source on GitHub</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Repositories: A GitHub repository is where a project’s codebase is stored. Repositories can be public or
            private. Public repositories are open to everyone and are the foundation of open-source projects.
        </li>
        <li>Forking: Forking allows a user to create a personal copy of someone else's repository. This is a standard
            way to start contributing to an open-source project. Once you have made changes, you can submit a pull
            request to the original repository.</li>
        <li>Pull Requests (PRs): Pull requests are a core feature of GitHub that allows developers to propose changes to
            a project’s codebase. PRs are reviewed by the project maintainers, who can discuss the changes, suggest
            modifications, and eventually merge the changes into the main codebase.</li>
        <li>Issues and Discussions: GitHub provides an integrated issue tracker and discussion platform where developers
            can report bugs, suggest new features, ask questions, and discuss implementation details. This fosters an
            open and transparent development process.</li>
